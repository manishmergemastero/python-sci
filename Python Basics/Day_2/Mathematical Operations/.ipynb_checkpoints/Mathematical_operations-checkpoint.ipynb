    "# In this lesson I want to show you some of the other mathematical operators \n",

    "# So, 7 -3, you would just use the minus sign, but then when you get to multiplication\n",
    "# it's little bit weird. Instead of using x or some sort of symbol, you actually\n",

    "# mathematical operations is when you have more than one operation on the same\n",

    "# So some of these operations like division or multiplication are going to be first class,\n",

    "# It makes it seem like as if multiplication happens before division, but actually they are equally important.\n",
    "# And when it actually comes to your calculations, the calculation that's most to the left is the one that will be prioritized between multiplication and division.\n",
